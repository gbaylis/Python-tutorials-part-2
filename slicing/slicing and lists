# slicing

digits = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

# start at 0, to 14, in increments of 2
print(digits[0:14:2]) # would print: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12

# create a variable with numbers and letters
name = "_1_2_3_a_b_c"
# print only the letters
# start at index 7, the last character is a letter, which means we can leave the 2nd number blank, this counts to the end
# skip every other character, to skip over the under scores.
print(name[7::2])

# print only the numbers
#start at index 0, stop at index 9 and only print 1 out of every 4 characters
number="1abc2def3ghi"
print(number[0:9:4])
