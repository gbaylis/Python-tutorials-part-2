a monster theme app, taking the randint function, and using it to replace an item from a list
the first example uses one list
the 2nd example has a list for each replacement. The 2nd version is better, because it will save time,
when using an item from any of the lists. 

The 3rd example is a made up scenario set in a fictional video rental store
it is meant to represent how to replace an item, if an item is removed by chance.

I added other examples to demonstrate what is possible with randint and lists
